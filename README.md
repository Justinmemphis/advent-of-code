# advent-of-code
This is where I keep the Advent of Code problems I have done.  I did the first few problems of Advent of Code 2023.

## How it's made:
I used Python for Advent of Code 2023.  I also experimented some with pandas and numpy libraries.

## Optimizations:
I try to solve the problem first and then I clean up my code to make it more readable.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about various kinds of data manipulation in python and with pandas and numpy libraries.
